At the request of my headmaster, I worked as a Quran teacher at SRI Darul Bayan while waiting for my SPM results. My schedule involved teaching Quran classes from <br>7 AM to 9 AM and then returning to school from 2 PM to 4 PM.<br> I taught students in <i>Grade 1</i>, who were a bit mischievous, but this experience greatly enhanced my skills in handling young children. Additionally, I conducted a tuition class for the Arabic language, as requested by the parents of my students. This tuition class took place only on Saturdays from 3 PM to 5 PM, with <u>a daily salary of RM 50. For the Quran classes, I received a monthly salary of RM 150.</u>

                    I worked as a promoter for Fiffy brand baby items at BabyWorld, where I focused on promoting products, assembling hampers, and managing stock. From all my experiences, I particularly loved working at BabyWorld the most. The environment was vibrant with many friends, most of whom were girls. <u>I worked four days a week, earning RM7.00 per hour, which totaled a monthly salary of RM1300.</u>I deeply enjoyed the camaraderie and found the work fulfilling.
